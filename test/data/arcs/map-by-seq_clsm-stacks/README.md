## The Content in Brief

This ARC contains content from the following publication:  

[Rapid Identification of a Natural Knockout Allele of ARMADILLO REPEAT-CONTAINING KINESIN1 (ARK1) That Causes Root Hair Branching by Mapping-By-Sequencing](https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.244046).

In this ARC, you can find CLSM z-stacks acquired to analyze ARK1 cytoskeletal localisation and it's modulation upon treatment in leaf epidermal cells.

Tif files were extracted with metadata from lif files of respective CLSM sessions. Tif files were chosen as these are accessible without additional tools.

I would like to thank all colleagues and students involved by contributing help e.g. for cloning and plant care in the Huelskamp lab and at the Institute of Plant Science including the greenhouse team beyond the authors of the linked [publication](https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.244046). :rocket:

## Description

The content of this ARC originates from the CLSM experimental part of a study which identified ARK1 with a mapping-by-sequencing approach to be causative for a root hair branching phenotype in only one *Arabidopsis thaliana* accession out of an accession panel.  

It is intended to serve as a microscopic, bio-imaging **use cases** and initial example ARC for further development and conversion steps of ARCs with other microscopy-related studies and structures.  

In the overarching mapping-by-sequencing project, we developed a strategy for *Arabidopsis thaliana* studies using different natural accessions to identify causative genes for distinct phenotypes. In these studies, an interesting phenotype can be found which is only represented by one or a few accessions. While the method of mapping-by-sequencing was developed already earlier, this study focusses on complementing GWAS studies for theses specific cases of low statistical power for causal gene detection in order to identify also genes underlying phenotypes of interest to a study with a low minor allele frequency in the panel. It makes use of three crossing instead of one in order to significantly reduce the mapping interval and uses additional information from the mapping panel and its respective sequences provided by the 1001 Genome Project.

## Project status & Roadmap

This microscopy ARC is intended to serve as a first example.  

LIF files should be added along with the extracted tiff files.

It contains already the relevant isa metadata and needs to be extended using the Swate tool for adding annotations for the included data and the respective experiment.
