OCT-embedded samples were cryo-sectioned as described above into 10 μm sections onto an MC slide. Fixation, permeabilization, hybridization and automated fluorescence microscopy imaging were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Molecular preparation of human brain (beta), Molecular coloring, workflow setup) except for a few adaptations indicated below. Briefly, slides were thawed at room temperature and dried at 37°C. Subsequently, the MC observation chamber was assembled by attaching sticky wells (8-well) to the MC slide. Sections were fixed, permeabilized, rehydrated and treated with TrueBlack (Biotium) autofluorescence quencher. In contrast to the MC protocol provided by Resolve Biosciences, we diluted the quencher 1:20 as specified by Biotium. Next, the sections were thoroughly washed and primed before the specific probes against our genes of interest were hybridized at 37°C overnight. The probe sequences were designed by Resolve Biosciences’ proprietary algorithm and are hence not listed here. After hybridization, the sections were washed, and the MC observation chamber was transferred to the MC machine for eight automated iterations of coloring and imaging to decipher the transcript localization of the 100 different genes of interest in the tissue. Therefore, regions of interest (ROIs) were selected for each section (MB263, MB266, MB295, MB299) based on a brightfield overview scan. In the last imaging round, Nuclei were stained with DAPI yielding a reference image for nuclei segmentation. After the run, the MC software performs registration of the raw images, assigns transcripts to the combinatorial color codes detected and combines individual tiles to ROI panoramas. The outputs are text files containing the transcript coordinates in 3D as well as maximum projections of DAPI images for each ROI. In the images, each pixel has a width and height of 138 nm (x- and y-axis in 2-dimensional space)
